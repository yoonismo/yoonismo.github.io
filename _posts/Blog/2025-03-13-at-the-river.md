When I was in college, I used to listen to radio a lot. It was one of the habits I had before the bed. There was a radio program in 
Korea, "Radio Paradise." The host of program was funny and had a good sense of music. The song I post is the opening song of the 
program. The program started at midnight sharp. Before the program started, there was always an announcement that alarms midnight. 
I started humming this song even before the announcement finished. What is he going to say as an opening comment today? What stories
will make me smile today? Such imagination made me not able to sleep until the program ended, 02:00 am (Yes, I was quite a night-owl).
